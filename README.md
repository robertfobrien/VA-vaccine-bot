## The Media Kit *GHOST SCRAPER*

This is an internal tool for scraping targeted influencers in order to create "ghost" media kits populated with public data that's available on these target's social profiles. These influencers can then later claim their pre-populate "ghost" profiles in the future.

Think of this strategy similar to how Yelp in their earlier days pre-populated business information and their pages on Yelp even before that business created an account on their platform. This gave Yelp's customers searching for business access to this information before it was directly supplied by the business. This was also a fantastic growth strategy for them and heavily leveraged SEO to drive traffic to their website.
